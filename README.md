## Feel-The-Bernoulli (Jacob Helwig, Jack Si, Yangxinyu Xie)

We have provided a robust support vector machine model that is adaptive to the changes of seasonality, with a mean absolute error equal to 0.298. Our model is capable of using real-time weather and water consumption data to predict electricity usage within households. Additionally, our preliminary analysis of solar energy generation indicates that to gain further insights in solar energy generation and usage in Austin, seasonality should be taken into account for improved insight and prediction.
